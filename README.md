### Self-Hosting

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- SurrealDB 1.5.5+
- FFmpeg (for media transcoding)
- Redis (optional, for caching)

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/zymo-tv/zymo-web.git
    cd zymo-web
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

3. Configure environment:

    ```shell
    cp .env.local.sample .env.local
    # Edit .env.local with your configuration
    ```

4. Install and start SurrealDB:

    ```shell
    curl -sSf https://install.surrealdb.com | sh
    surreal upgrade --version 1.5.5
    npm run db:start
    ```

5. Run database migrations:

    ```shell
    chmod 755 ./migrations/*.sh
    for f in ./migrations/*.sh; do ./$f; done
    node ./migrations/scripts/migrate.js up
    ```

6. Install FFmpeg (for media processing):

    ```shell
    ./bin/install-ffmpeg.sh
    ```

7. Start the server:

    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```

    Access your zymo.tv instance at `http://localhost:3000`

## Configuration

### Media Libraries

Configure your media directories in the dashboard:
- Movies: `/path/to/movies`
- TV Shows: `/path/to/tv`
- Music: `/path/to/music`
- Podcasts: Managed through RSS feeds
- Books: `/path/to/books`

### Remote Access

For remote access, configure your router's port forwarding or use a reverse proxy like nginx.

### Transcoding

zymo.tv automatically transcodes media for optimal streaming. Configure transcoding settings in the admin panel based on your server's capabilities.

### Using Production API in Local Development

If you want to develop locally while connecting to the production API instead of running your own database, follow these steps:

1. Copy the environment sample file:

    ```shell
    cp .env.local.sample .env.local
    ```

2. Edit `.env.local` and configure the database connection to point to production:

    ```shell
    # Production API Configuration
    DB_HOST=https://api.zymo.tv
    DB_SQL_URL=https://api.zymo.tv/sql
    DB_RPC_URL=https://api.zymo.tv/rpc
    DB_WS_HOST=wss://api.zymo.tv
    
    # Use production namespace and database
    DB_NS=zymo
    DB_DB=zymo
    
    # Production credentials (contact support for access)
    DB_USER=your_production_user
    DB_PASS=your_production_password
    ```

3. Update other production-specific settings as needed:

    ```shell
    APP_DOMAIN=zymo.tv
    APP_NAME=zymo
    MAILGUN_DOMAIN=mg.zymo.tv
    FROM_EMAIL=hello@zymo.tv
    ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```shell
    pnpm run dev
    ```

**Note**: You'll need production API credentials to connect. Contact the zymo.tv team for access. This setup is useful for:
- Frontend development without running the full backend stack
- Testing against production data
- Debugging production issues locally

**Security Warning**: Never commit your `.env.local` file with production credentials to version control. The `.gitignore` file should already exclude this file.
